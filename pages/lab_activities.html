          <h3>TUBE</h3>
          <div>There is an urgent need to understand the interplay of pollutants with 
            adverse effects in the brain, in order to steer political decision making 
            for efficient reduction of air pollutants. This could, in the long run, 
            reduce the economic burden caused by diseases associated with them. To 
            address this unmet need, the TUBE-project unites interdisciplinary expertise 
            to study these adverse effects of extremely fine particles (UFP’s) in the 
            human lung and brain. Leaning on this interdisciplinary approach and state 
            of the art research methodologies, TUBE will aim to discover the harmful 
            components of air pollution and identify biomarkers for early detection 
            of brain disease related to air pollution. This could improve brain health, 
            reduce the prevalence of brain diseases, provide significant economical 
            savings, and provide data that will be used to support planning future 
            traffic policy across the EU. <a href="https://www.tube-project.eu/"

          <h3>ADAIR</h3>
          <div>
            ADAIR applies a precision medicine approach to stratify individuals to 
            subgroups for risk estimation and future AD prevention, ultimately aiming 
            to target air pollution induced effects in those individualsthat can most 
            benefit from them. The project investigates the novel, ambitious hypothesis 
            that the pollutant exposure environment of an individual alters cellular 
            mechanisms and functions, resulting in the expression of measurable biomarkers. 
            By identifying biomarkers, the individuals with increased AD risk can be 
            stratified prior to the disease onset and preventive measures can be 
            targeted to the specific at-risk populations in order to be most effective.<br>
            The main objectives are to:
          <ul>
            <li>Discover biomarkers of air pollutant effects.</li>
            <li>Correlate biomarkers to AD risk to identify sub-groups of 
            individuals with an increased susceptibility for air pollutant effects.</li>
            <li>Better understand how the exposure environment is linked with complex 
            disease mechanisms underlying AD, thus paving the way for future 
            therapeutic approaches.</li>

          <div>The University of Eastern Finland has received EU funding to recruit 
            14 doctoral students into a four-year multidisciplinary Neuro-Innovation 
            PhD programme, which will be implemented on the Kuopio campus. The University
            of Verona and Infomics research group are partners of the neuro-innovation PhD programme.
            The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Cofund grant of 1,5 million euros will 
            increase the scope and quality of multidisciplinary research in the 
            UEF Neuroscience Research Community (NEURO). Thereby, it will also 
            generate a strong positive impact on health innovation in Finland and beyond.
            The recruitment of the international PhD students will start in June 2021.

              Computational biology is a field that involves the analysis of biological systems 
              at various levels of complexity, using appropriate modeling frameworks and 
              computational methods. With the advancement of computational biology approaches 
              and modeling systems, the current challenge is to employ these techniques to 
              define personalized models that identify tailored drugs and therapies, thus 
              realizing the <i>personalized medicine</i> paradigm. The aim of this special 
              session is to bring together researchers who are working on the development of
              methods and models applied in the fields of computational biology and systems 
              medicine to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and ideas in these innovative

            Bioinformatics Community. The symposium is open to all interested attendees of BITS Annual 
            Meeting and we strongly encourage participation of experienced researchers who can provide 
            precious feedback and support to presenting students. The symposium will also feature invited 
            talks from established scientists as well as a roundtable discussion about becoming a Principal

            Modern molecular and cell biology no longer focus on single macromolecules 
            but now look into complexes, pathways or even entire organism interactomes. 
            The emerging field of network biology is now mainly centred on unravelling 
            these relationships and developing novel methodologies to extract the 
            information that they contain. A deeper knowledge of the global topology 
            of interactome networks, and how they change in response to insults (i.e. 
            disease states) will have important bearings in many scientific areas, 
            from evolutionary biology to biomedical research.

          <p>Structural variants (SVs) are large genomic alterations (> 50 bp). These 
            genomic variants are typically classified as deletions, duplications,
            insertions, inversions, and translocations describig different combinations 
            of DNA gains, losses, or rearrangements.

            <b>What the student will do?</b>
            <br>
            - Learn how to work and structure platforms based on federated data.
            <br>
            - Co-develop an efficient user interface that will allow clinicians to
            visualize, filter and analyze SVs derived from sequencing data.
